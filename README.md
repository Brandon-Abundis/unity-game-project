# Overview of Game
This project aims to develop a 3D puzzle game using the Unity game engine where the
player must use the probable futuristic technology of teleportation to navigate challenging levels.
The game will be set in a 1950s post-apocalypse world where technological innovation grew
exponentially faster than our timeline but at the cost of the human race. The player takes on the
role of a test subject in a secret soviet base in the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, tasked with
solving increasingly difficult puzzles maintained by automatons who scientists created before
the great dying. Every puzzle allows the player to use teleportation technology to warp physical
objects and change their inertia to solve said objective in the puzzle, another step to escaping
this facility. The teleportation technology will also allow the player to travel from one point in the
level to another, often using tangible portals. The game will feature innovative gameplay
mechanics; engaging level design, but the compelling storyline will not take itself seriously as,
after decades of decay, the automatons have lost their edge in critical thinking.

# How to Run the Game

You can Run the Game through the executable file called `Game.exe`

## Else, Initial Dependencies
1. Go to the Unity website: [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/download ), and download the software.
2. Open up the Unity Hub Application and navigate to the installs on the left section of the UI.
3. Find the Unity version number 2021.xx, and install. It is essential to download the correct year of 2021, or you will get dependency problems.
4. You will need to go back to the Projects section from the left side of the Unity Hub application; once there, you will click on the project.
5. Once opened, you will click on the file option on the top left of the project.
6. Then you will build and run the project, which will launch the Game.

### Friendly Bot

There is a floating bot that follows you arrownd that is supposed

- This floating bot allows the player to shoot portals into the envirnoment, with colored lasers representing the corresponding portals.

# Future Possible Implementations

## Improving Portal Mechanics

- As of right now, the portal mechanic is not that great, we wish to make a better implementation of this.

## Movement

- The movement of the player is still kinda bad, a better version of this movement is possible to implement.

## Tools

- The ability to pick up objects is desired.
